# LLM Awesome Wiki

## Status: Failed LLM Wiki, Useful Agent Workflow Record

This repository failed as an LLM wiki distillation system.

Do not adopt it as a recommended workflow, production system, or foundation for
new knowledge-base work. The knowledge-distillation workflow became too
document-heavy, process-heavy, and indirect, and it did not reliably beat
direct LLM reading and iterative prompting on real PPT/PDF-heavy material.

The useful residue is the Agent-assisted development workflow around
`AGENTS.md`, `docs/`, `plan/`, git discipline, scoped ownership, target plans,
logs, validation, and commit/push hygiene. That workflow is the main artifact
worth studying here.

## What Failed

The LLM wiki distillation system failed.

The project could define source packets, wiki construction rules, compare
reports, review queues, validators, and fixtures, but it could not reliably
constrain large-scale distillation completeness. A checker can verify that
fields, links, reports, and references exist; it cannot easily prove that the
important content in dozens of slides, pages, charts, diagrams, formulas, and
images survived into the distilled wiki at the right level of detail.

The PDF/PPT/image-to-text layer also remains under-researched. Reliable
conversion from multimodal classroom or technical material into useful source
packets is its own serious problem: layout, slide order, charts, formulas,
tables, screenshots, OCR, image captions, and visual reasoning all need deeper
investigation. This repository intentionally avoided becoming an extractor
harness, but without a strong input layer the later workflow could not deliver
enough value.

There was also a practical capacity constraint: the author was in finals week.
Continuing responsibly would have required a full research pass on multimodal
extraction and real corpus evaluation, not another round of workflow
documents.

## What Remains Useful

The Agent development workflow remains useful.

The strongest part of this repository is not the wiki architecture, but the
working discipline for humans and coding agents:

```text
AGENTS.md
-> target plan
-> scoped file ownership
-> implementation
-> validation
-> log update
-> commit
-> push
```

This pattern helped keep a complex, fast-moving repository auditable. It is
worth extracting into a smaller future template for Agent-driven software or
research projects.

Useful workflow ideas include:

- write repository-level agent rules in `AGENTS.md`
- require a target-specific plan before edits
- declare owned files and read-only files
- audit dirty git state before work
- keep personal and global maintenance logs
- run explicit validation commands
- make small commits with clear status records
- preserve design history in `docs/`
- separate working plans from durable architecture notes

The first portable extraction of this discipline now lives under
`agent-workflow-kernel/`. It reframes the reusable mainline as:

```text
plan
-> implementation
-> validation
-> log
-> experience
-> commit
```

The content below is historical context for the failed LLM Wiki attempt.

LLM Awesome Wiki is a VSCode-native, Git-first knowledge distillation system
for humans and agents.

It is not an Obsidian vault, not the `llm_wiki` desktop app, and not a
PDF/PPTX extractor harness. The system repository defines the reusable
workflow: skills, rules, templates, schemas, checker tools, fixtures, and
maintenance discipline for creating independent knowledge workspace repos.

## What This System Does

The default workflow is:

```text
raw resources
-> source inventory and source packets
-> semantic draft from source packets plus raw/rendered/external reading
-> grounding pass to source anchors, evidence, and review items
-> accepted source/chapter wiki pages
-> compare, review, lint, and closure reports
-> stable knowledge release
-> later downstream specs, skills, tools, tests, and code
```

Source packets are required, but they are an audit baseline rather than the
semantic ceiling for wiki construction. A wiki round may use direct reading of
raw files, rendered pages, external extractor output, or high-density notes to
draft knowledge, then it must ground accepted knowledge back to stable source
anchors or route uncertainty to review.

Two execution layers stay separate:

- **Knowledge-construction layer**: checks and maintains the wiki workflow
  itself with source inventory, source packet lint, wiki lint, reports, review
  queues, and closure checks.
- **Downstream knowledge-to-code layer**: later `skill + tool` or code
  artifacts derived from a stable, traceable knowledge release.

Do not collapse these into one pass.

## Current Status

This repository is no longer considered an active success path. It is retained
as a failed system-design record.

Before being marked failed, the repository completed a first major system pass:

- Phase 1 defined a copyable workspace skeleton and the surrounding kernel
  bundle assets.
- Phases 2 through 5 defined source packet, evidence/claim, wiki construction,
  compare, review, and closure protocols.
- Phase 6 implemented the checker-first Python CLI under `llm_wiki_tools/`.
- Runtime workflow entrypoints now live under `skills/`.
- Detailed workflow semantics live under `rules/`.
- Historical plans and design records live under `docs/`.

The old root `llm-wiki.md` concept note has been archived at
`docs/archive/llm-wiki.md`. It is background material, not the current runtime
entrypoint.

Phase 7, downstream knowledge-to-`skill + tool`, was not started. The project
should not be extended in its current form without a redesign that removes
process weight and proves a simpler real-user path first.

## Repository Layout

This is the **system repository**, not an active knowledge workspace.

```text
AGENTS.md                  # required rules for agents working in this repo
agent-workflow-kernel/     # portable plan-log-experience workflow extraction

docs/archive/              # archived concept/background documents
llm_wiki/                  # pinned reference submodule, read-only by default
llm_wiki_tools/            # runnable Python checker CLI and command index
MinerU/                    # pinned optional extractor reference submodule
plan/                      # target plans and maintenance logs
rules/                     # detailed source, wiki, claim, and review rules
skills/                    # runtime agent entrypoints
templates/                 # copyable workspace skeleton and artifact templates
tests/                     # fixture and checker validation material
```

A generated knowledge workspace may contain:

```text
raw/sources/               # immutable source files
raw/derived/               # source packets and extracted media
wiki/                      # maintained source/chapter knowledge pages
reports/                   # compare, coverage, lint, review, closure outputs
contracts/schemas/         # copied or pinned schema/config contracts
skills/                    # copied or synchronized runtime guides
rules/                     # copied or synchronized detailed reference rules
tools/                     # workspace-local helpers if a user chooses to add them
tests/                     # workspace-specific validation and fixtures
```

Do not create live root-level `raw/`, `wiki/`, `reports/`, or `schema.md` in
this system repo. Workspace data belongs in generated workspace repos,
examples, fixtures, or ignored local scratch areas.

## Workspace Topology

The project has four distinct forms:

- **System repo**: this repository. It develops reusable assets.
- **Workspace skeleton**: `templates/workspace-kernel/`. It creates the
  starting artifact layout for a new workspace.
- **Workspace kernel bundle**: the skeleton plus copied or synchronized
  `skills/`, `rules/`, `contracts/schemas/`, and checker access.
- **Knowledge workspace repo**: an independent Git repo that owns live
  `raw/`, `wiki/`, `reports/`, and corpus commits.

`templates/workspace-kernel/` alone is not the complete runtime bundle. A
portable workspace should know where its skills, rules, contracts, and checker
tools came from.

Checker access currently supports two modes:

- **Development tool mode**: run this system repo's `llm_wiki_tools` against a
  workspace path with `--workspace <path>`.
- **Portable tool mode**: install or vendor the checker package so the
  workspace can run checks locally.

See `docs/top-level-design/workspace-topology-contract.md` for the full
contract.

## Runtime Entrypoints

For agents:

- Start from `skills/llm-wiki-distill/SKILL.md`.
- Use `skills/llm-wiki-source-packet/SKILL.md` for source packet work.
- Use `skills/llm-wiki-wiki-round/SKILL.md` for wiki construction rounds.
- Use `skills/llm-wiki-quality-gate/SKILL.md` for compare, review, validation,
  and closure.

For detailed semantics:

- Use `rules/README.md` as the rule index.
- Source packet behavior lives under `rules/source/`.
- Wiki construction behavior lives under `rules/wiki/`.
- Evidence and claim behavior lives under `rules/claims/`.
- Review lifecycle behavior lives under `rules/review/`.

For executable checks:

```bash
python -m llm_wiki_tools validate-kernel
python -m llm_wiki_tools workspace-check --workspace . --mode all
```

See `llm_wiki_tools/README.md` for the current command index.

## Working Rules

Before modifying the repository:

1. Run `git status --short --branch`.
2. Audit dirty state and ownership.
3. Create a target-specific plan under `plan/users/<user>/<date-goal-slug>/`.
4. Edit only the files owned by that target plan.

After modifying:

1. Update personal and global maintenance logs as required.
2. Run the validation listed in the target plan.
3. Stage only intended files.
4. Commit with a clear message.
5. Push to `origin/main`, unless a different branch or remote is explicitly
   requested.

See `AGENTS.md` for the full rules.

## Relationship To Reference Repos

`llm_wiki/` is a pinned reference submodule. It is useful for studying source
identity, ingest, image handling, frontmatter cleanup, review queues, search,
and graph-derived gap discovery. It is not this repository's runtime or product
target.

`MinerU/` is a pinned optional extractor reference submodule. It may inform how
external extraction backends shape outputs, but this repository does not own a
MinerU runner or a document parsing harness.

Do not edit either submodule unless a target plan explicitly asks to update the
reference pointer or work inside that submodule.

## How Developers Should Join

Start here:

1. Read this README.
2. Read `AGENTS.md`.
3. Read `docs/top-level-design/system-architecture-plan.md`.
4. Check `plan/log.md` for recent decisions.
5. For implementation work, create a new target plan before editing files.

Good current contributions are narrow and evidence-backed:

- improve real workspace fixtures
- improve semantic-draft and grounding templates for real document/PPT corpora
- harden checker behavior in `llm_wiki_tools/`
- clarify rule language where validators expose ambiguity
- improve workspace skeleton and kernel bundle templates
- document stable knowledge-release criteria

Avoid broad tasks like "build the whole system", "generate all wiki pages", or
"turn Phase 7 on" before the construction loop is proven on real examples.
