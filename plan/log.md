# Maintenance Log

## 2026-06-22 - Agent workflow kernel extraction

- Target: extract a portable `agent-workflow-kernel/` from the useful Agent
  workflow residue so the plan-log-experience mainline is not hidden inside
  LLM Wiki-specific rules.

  source-packet, wiki-round, and quality-gate workflow.
- Changed areas: generated local workspace outputs under
  `workspace/local/adctoolbox-adc-basic-ch1-ch10-distill/`; added the target
  plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-05-adctoolbox-ch1-ch10-workspace-distill/`;
  updated `plan/users/chenzc24/log.md`.

## 2026-06-05 - Refactor workflow toward semantic-first grounding

- Target: change the current system direction after real PPT/PDF distillation
  showed that structurally valid source-packet-first output can be much weaker
  than a direct high-density semantic reading.
- Changed areas: updated README, core philosophy, knowledge-to-executable,
  top-level architecture, runtime skills, wiki rules, workspace-kernel
  guidance, compare/validation/construction templates, chapter template, and
  the target plan under

- Design review: the construction path is now
  `source packet + raw/rendered/external reading -> semantic draft ->
  grounding pass -> accepted wiki -> compare/review/closure`. Source packets
  remain the audit baseline for anchors and gaps, but not the semantic ceiling.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending
  warnings; `python -m llm_wiki_tools validate-kernel` passed;

- Target: close Phase 5 from the Person B workflow-surface side by reviewing
  the complete compare gates and review workflow and handing Person A/Phase 6
  validation and tooling needs forward.
- Changed areas: added the Phase 5 closure review; updated the main Phase 5
  plan, phase-plan index, and target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-5-6-closure-review/`.
- Design review: Phase 5 is closed as a protocol and template surface. It
  defines compare reports, source/wiki coverage, claim/modality/contradiction
  checks, review queue lifecycle, and round closure decisions, while leaving
  schemas, validators, fixtures, and tools to Phase 6.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  Phase 5 closure and Phase 6 handoff language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as `9e3aad0 Close phase five compare gate
  workflow`; finalized by the follow-up maintenance-status commit.

- Target: rebaseline Phase 6 as workspace validation and checker tooling
  after the no-harness decision.
- Changed areas: added the Phase 6.0 rebaseline plan; updated top-level
  architecture, execution roadmap, phase-plan index, Phase 2 tool surface
  references, collaboration guidance, tool README, source packet convert
  README, and target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-6-0-validation-tooling-rebaseline/`.
- Design review: Phase 6 is now checker-first. It validates workspace artifacts
  and source packet outputs, while extractor execution and downstream
  knowledge-to-`skill + tool` generation remain out of scope.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  Phase 6.0 rebaseline language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as `0e68250 Rebaseline phase six as validation
  tooling`; finalized by the follow-up maintenance-status commit.

  report/exit-code conventions for future workspace validators.
- Changed areas: added the Phase 6.1 plan, shared tool conventions,
  `workspace-check` README and PowerShell skeleton, and target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-6-1-tool-runtime-skeleton/`; updated
  the Phase 6 rebaseline plan, phase-plan index, and tools README.
- Design review: Phase 6 now has a runnable checker shell that emits stable
  Markdown reports and marks future business validators as `not-implemented`
  without running extractors or parsing raw binaries.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed; `workspace-check.ps1`
  smoke run passed; temporary reports were removed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  Phase 6.1 runtime skeleton language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as `990f384 Add phase six tool runtime
  skeleton`; finalized by the follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Add phase six schema checker

- Target: implement Phase 6.2 schema and structured-field validation as the
  first real checker in the Phase 6 validation tooling layer.
- Changed areas: added the Phase 6.2 plan and `schema-check` tool; aligned key
  schema fields and enums; integrated schema checking into `workspace-check`;
  updated `validate-kernel`, Phase 6 docs, tool READMEs, and target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-6-2-schema-structured-field-validation/`.
- Design review: Phase 6.2 checks reusable contract shape and workflow
  vocabulary only. It does not validate full workspace artifact instances or
  run extractors.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed; `schema-check.ps1` and
  `workspace-check.ps1 -Mode schemas` smoke runs passed; temporary reports were
  removed; targeted `rg` confirmed Phase 6.2 schema checker language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as `b3e2c37 Add phase six schema checker`;
  finalized by the follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Add phase six source artifact checkers

- Target: implement Phase 6.3 source inventory and source packet output
  validators for workspace artifacts.
- Changed areas: added the Phase 6.3 plan; implemented source inventory and
  source packet lint checkers; integrated `workspace-check -Mode source`;
  updated `validate-kernel`, Phase 6 docs, tool READMEs, and target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-6-3-source-artifact-checkers/`.
- Design review: Phase 6.3 checks source identity, raw path/hash, packet path,
  metadata, anchors, generated fields, gaps, review routing, and derived
  artifact references without running extractors or generating wiki pages.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed; temporary smoke
  workspace passed `source-inventory-check.ps1`, `source-packet-lint.ps1`, and
  `workspace-check.ps1 -Mode source`; targeted `rg` confirmed Phase 6.3 source
  artifact checker language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `30f7cf1 Add phase six source artifact checkers`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Add phase six wiki lint checker

- Target: implement Phase 6.4 wiki lint and navigation validation for existing
  wiki artifacts.
- Changed areas: added the Phase 6.4 plan; implemented `wiki-lint`; integrated
  `workspace-check -Mode wiki`; updated `validate-kernel`, Phase 6 docs, tool
  READMEs, and target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-6-4-wiki-lint-navigation/`.
- Design review: Phase 6.4 checks special wiki files, frontmatter, links, index
  membership, overview sections, and log headings without generating pages or
  resolving semantic review.
- Validation: temporary smoke workspace passed `wiki-lint.ps1` and
  `workspace-check.ps1 -Mode wiki`; `git diff --check` passed with only
  Windows line-ending warnings; `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1`
  passed; targeted `rg` confirmed Phase 6.4 wiki lint language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as `7541178 Add phase six wiki lint checker`;
  finalized by the follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Add phase six report surface checker

- Target: implement Phase 6.5 report surface validation for compare,
  claim/evidence, review queue, and validation-note reports.
- Changed areas: added the Phase 6.5 plan; implemented `report-check`;
  integrated `workspace-check -Mode reports`; updated `validate-kernel`, Phase
  6 docs, tool READMEs, and target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-6-5-report-surface-checker/`.
- Design review: Phase 6.5 checks Markdown report structure and obvious status
  consistency without extracting claims, resolving semantic truth, rewriting
  reports, generating wiki pages, or closing rounds.
- Validation: temporary smoke workspace passed `report-check.ps1` and
  `workspace-check.ps1 -Mode reports`; `git diff --check` passed with only
  Windows line-ending warnings; `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1`
  passed; targeted `rg` confirmed Phase 6.5 report checker language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `6151b30 Add phase six report surface checker`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Add phase six round closure checker

- Target: implement Phase 6.6 round closure consistency validation.
- Changed areas: added the Phase 6.6 plan; implemented
  `round-closure-check`; integrated `workspace-check -Mode closure`; updated
  `validate-kernel`, Phase 6 docs, tool READMEs, and target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-6-6-round-closure-checker/`.
- Design review: Phase 6.6 checks closure decisions against validation note,
  compare/review state, index/log visibility, and active report
  discoverability without closing rounds or resolving semantic truth.
- Validation: temporary smoke workspace passed `round-closure-check.ps1` and
  `workspace-check.ps1 -Mode closure`; `git diff --check` passed with only
  Windows line-ending warnings; `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1`
  passed; targeted `rg` confirmed Phase 6.6 closure checker language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `5878219 Add phase six round closure checker`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Add phase six fixture runner

- Target: implement Phase 6.7 scenario fixture runner and minimum checker
  scenarios.
- Changed areas: added the Phase 6.7 plan; implemented `fixture-runner`; added
  `tests/fixtures/phase6/` pass/fail/needs-review scenarios; integrated
  `workspace-check -Mode fixtures`; updated `validate-kernel`, Phase 6 docs,
  tool READMEs, test docs, and target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-6-7-fixture-runner/`.
- Design review: Phase 6.7 tests checker status and exit behavior without
  running extractors, generating artifacts, or resolving semantic review.
- Validation: `fixture-runner.ps1` passed; `workspace-check.ps1 -Mode fixtures`
  passed and invoked the fixture runner; generated smoke reports were removed;
  `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  Phase 6.7 fixture validation language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `b3962af Add phase six fixture runner`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Close phase six validation tooling

- Target: complete Phase 6 closure review and record the boundary to Phase 7.
- Changed areas: added the Phase 6 closure review; updated the Phase 6 main
  plan, phase-plan index, tool README, and target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-6-8-closure-review/`.
- Design review: Phase 6 is closed as validation/checker tooling, not as an
  extractor harness, wiki generator, semantic reviewer, or downstream
  `skill + tool` generator.
- Validation: `git diff --check`, `validate-kernel`, `schema-check`,
  `fixture-runner`, and `workspace-check -Mode fixtures` passed; generated
  smoke reports were removed; targeted `rg` confirmed closure and Phase 7
  boundary language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `12baac7 Close phase six validation tooling`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Migrate phase six tooling to Python CLI

- Target: replace implemented Phase 6 PowerShell checker scripts with the
  Python CLI runtime.
- Changed areas: added `pyproject.toml` and `llm_wiki_tools/`; deleted
  implemented `.ps1` tool scripts; updated tool READMEs, Phase 6 docs, tests
  docs, and target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-6-9-python-tooling-runtime/`.
- Design review: migration improves portability and maintainability without
  changing Phase 6 into an extractor harness, wiki generator, semantic
  reviewer, or downstream `skill + tool` generator.
- Validation: `git diff --check`, Python compile, `validate-kernel`,
  `schema-check`, `fixture-runner`, and `workspace-check --mode fixtures`
  passed; generated smoke reports were removed; `rg` confirmed no `.ps1` tool
  files remain and active command docs use Python CLI commands.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `735a4da Migrate phase six tooling to Python CLI`; finalized by the
  follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Add Person B workflow closure review

- Target: close the Person B workflow-surface question for source packet
  profiles and wiki construction.
- Changed areas: added
  `docs/collaboration/person-b-workflow-closure-review.md`; updated
  `docs/collaboration/README.md`; added the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-person-b-workflow-closure-review/`.
- Design review: Person B workflow prose is sufficient for Person A to begin
  fixture and validator hardening; extractor harnesses and deterministic wiki
  generation remain out of scope.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending
  warnings; `python -m llm_wiki_tools validate-kernel` passed; targeted `rg`
  confirmed closure review handoff and boundary language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `c27ee85 Add person B workflow closure review`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Consolidate rules progressive disclosure

- Target: reorganize `rules/` from flat phase-accumulated files into
  progressive-disclosure workflow entrypoints.
- Changed areas: added evidence/claim and wiki-surface owner rules; converted
  historical split rule files into compatibility entries; rewrote the rules
  README; reduced compare-gate duplicate semantic definitions; updated
  workspace-kernel guidance, top-level rules guidance, Python kernel
  validation, and target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-rules-progressive-disclosure-consolidation/`.
- Design review: rule semantics are kept, but the default reader path is now
  entrypoint-first and module-based. Coverage, review lifecycle,
  claim/modality, evidence/claim, and wiki surface semantics each have one
  owner file.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `python -m llm_wiki_tools validate-kernel` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  progressive-disclosure entrypoints, compatibility stubs, new owner files, and
  reduced compare-gate duplicate tables.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `e4b6da2 Consolidate rules progressive disclosure`; finalized by the
  follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Add agent skill entrypoints

- Target: add Agent-facing skill entrypoints for end-to-end LLM Wiki
  distillation.
- Changed areas: updated `AGENTS.md`; added four repo-local skills for
  end-to-end distillation, source packet workflow, wiki construction rounds,
  and quality gates; updated Python kernel validation; added the target plan
  under `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-agent-skill-entrypoints/`.
- Design review: operational workflow entry is now `skills/` plus `rules/`,
  not a new `docs/` runbook. Skills are process routers; rules remain the
  semantic source of truth.
- Validation: skill quick validation passed for all four skills; targeted `rg`
  confirmed skill names, docs/rules/skills boundary language, and no TODO
  placeholders; `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending
  warnings; `python -m llm_wiki_tools validate-kernel` passed.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `d8860b7 Add agent skill entrypoints`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Prepare Person A dry-run v2 handoff

- Target: provide Person A with a current-system local dry-run workspace and
  clarify ownership of Python validator/checker implementation.
- Changed areas: added
  `docs/collaboration/person-a-dry-run-v2-review-brief.md`; updated
  collaboration ownership docs; created ignored local dry-run output under
  `workspace/local/adctoolbox-ch1-dry-run-v2/`; added the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-person-a-dry-run-v2-handoff/`.
- Design review: the handoff distinguishes Person B workflow/template ownership
  from Person A schema, fixture, and `llm_wiki_tools/**` checker
  implementation ownership.
- Validation: local v2 passed `workspace-check --mode all`; `git diff
  --check`, `python -m llm_wiki_tools validate-kernel`, and targeted `rg`
  passed during final commit validation.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `845ce1a Clarify person A validation handoff`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Collapse tool docs into Python package

- Target: remove root-level `tools/` as a standalone documentation directory
  and put the current checker command index beside the runnable Python CLI.
- Changed areas: added `llm_wiki_tools/README.md`; updated
  `llm_wiki_tools/cli.py` kernel validation; removed obsolete root-level
  `tools/**` README/spec files; updated current README, top-level architecture,
  execution-roadmap, collaboration, and Phase 6 closure references.
- Design review: workflow semantics remain in `rules/**`; historical phase
  planning remains in `docs/phase-plans/**`; runnable checker implementation
  and concise command usage now live under `llm_wiki_tools/**`.
- Validation: `python -m py_compile llm_wiki_tools/cli.py
  llm_wiki_tools/__main__.py` passed; `python -m llm_wiki_tools
  validate-kernel` passed; root-level `tools/` no longer exists.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `d480ae2 Collapse tool docs into Python package`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Slim duplicate rules prose

- Target: compact the largest rule owner documents after progressive
  disclosure consolidation.
- Changed areas: slimmed the raw-to-source-packet, distillation-round,
  source-packet-to-wiki, wiki-surface, evidence/claim, and compare-gate rules;
  added the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-rules-slimming-pass/`.
- Design review: no rule path was removed and no schema or checker behavior was
  changed. Duplicate explanations were collapsed into owner-rule references
  while preserving the workflow-critical fields, statuses, review triggers,
  and acceptance criteria.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `python -m llm_wiki_tools validate-kernel` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  required distillation-flow terms; the six edited rule files were reduced by
  424 net lines.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `1f0408e Slim duplicate rules prose`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Remove rules compatibility stubs

- Target: remove obsolete compatibility stub files from `rules/` so the
  current rules directory exposes only semantic owner entrypoints.
- Changed areas: deleted six compatibility stubs, updated the rules entry map,
  removed the old `wiki-index-contract` validator requirement, updated current
  Person B collaboration references, and added the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-remove-rules-compatibility-stubs/`.
- Design review: this is a navigation cleanup only. Evidence/claim rules and
  wiki surface rules keep their consolidated owner files; historical records
  were not rewritten.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `python -m llm_wiki_tools validate-kernel` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  the deleted stub paths are gone from current-facing entrypoints; `Test-Path`
  confirmed all six stub files are absent.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `6e4d03a Remove obsolete rule compatibility stubs`; finalized by the
  follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Group rules by workflow area

- Target: make `rules/` structurally match progressive disclosure by grouping
  rule owner files into workflow, source, wiki, claims, and review directories.
- Changed areas: moved the active rule files into grouped subdirectories;
  updated `rules/README.md`, Agent skill references, current docs, and kernel
  validation required paths; added the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-rules-directory-restructure/`.
- Design review: this is a navigation and path cleanup, not a semantic change.
  `rules/README.md` remains the first rule entrypoint and now shows the
  directory map before the golden path and semantic ownership map.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `python -m llm_wiki_tools validate-kernel` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  current-facing references use grouped rule paths; `rg --files rules`
  confirmed the grouped layout.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `a016187 Group rules by workflow area`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Consolidate workflow runtime into skills

- Target: complete the Stage 1-3 runtime migration from workflow rules into
  skills.
- Changed areas: rewrote the four LLM Wiki skills as runtime cards; added a
  parity review proving coverage against the old `rules/workflow/**` baseline;
  removed `rules/workflow/**`; updated the rules index, current README,
  architecture, collaboration handoff docs, skill metadata, and kernel
  validator required paths; added the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-skill-runtime-consolidation-stage-3/`.
- Design review: normal execution now starts from an active skill. Detailed
  rules remain available for source, wiki, claim, and review edge cases, but
  no longer act as the default workflow runtime.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending
  warnings; `python -m py_compile llm_wiki_tools/cli.py
  llm_wiki_tools/__main__.py` passed; `python -m llm_wiki_tools
  validate-kernel` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed runtime and
  progressive-disclosure language in skills and rules; `rules/workflow`
  references are limited to migration review/historical wording, and the local
  `rules/workflow` directory is absent.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `eef4fc6 Consolidate workflow runtime into skills`; finalized by the
  follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Run ADCtoolbox ch2-ch4 PDF distillation test

- Target: test the current workflow on three real ADCtoolbox PDF lecture decks
  in an ignored local workspace.
- Changed areas: generated
  `workspace/local/adctoolbox-ch2-ch4-pdf-distill-test/` with copied raw PDFs,
  source inventory, source packets, source/chapter wiki pages, overview, index,
  wiki log, construction analysis, compare report, review queue, validation
  note, and `.checks/` reports; added the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-adctoolbox-ch2-ch4-pdf-distill-test/`.
- Design review: the real-PDF dry run exercised the intended path from raw
  source copies to source packets, wiki construction, reports, and closure. The
  output is a first-pass text-based distillation and intentionally carries
  visual/equation review forward as `close-with-review`.
- Validation: `workspace-check --mode all` passed for the generated workspace;
  schema, source inventory, source packet, wiki lint, report, closure, and
  fixture checks passed.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `1883a3f Record ADCtoolbox ch2-ch4 distillation test`; finalized by the
  follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Refresh README and archive old concept note

- Target: update the root README as the current Person B-facing system
  entrypoint, archive the old root `llm-wiki.md` concept note, and remove the
  obsolete root workspace divergence note.
- Changed areas: rewrote `README.md`; moved `llm-wiki.md` to
  `docs/archive/llm-wiki.md`; deleted
  `workspace/human-agent-rule-divergence.md`; added the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-person-b-readme-archive-cleanup/`.
- Design review: README now reflects Phase 6 completion, skill runtime
  entrypoints, rules as detailed references, `llm_wiki_tools/` as the checker
  CLI, and the system repo as not an active knowledge workspace.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `python -m llm_wiki_tools validate-kernel` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  current README entrypoint language; file checks confirmed root `llm-wiki.md`
  is absent, archived `docs/archive/llm-wiki.md` exists, and
  `workspace/human-agent-rule-divergence.md` is deleted.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `b762b2e Refresh README and archive old concept note`; finalized by the
  follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Harden wiki coverage gate

- Target: make document/PPT wiki construction closure coverage-aware after the
  ADCtoolbox ch3 dry run exposed overly shallow but structurally valid
  distillation.
- Changed areas: updated the wiki-round and quality-gate runtime skills,
  `rules/wiki/source-wiki-coverage-protocol.md`, report templates, the
  `report-check` checker, and Phase 6 report-check fixtures.
- Design review: skills remain the runtime entrypoint and rules remain the
  detailed semantic reference. The new check is mechanical: compare reports
  must expose source coverage, anchor disposition, and wiki page coverage; it
  still does not pretend to judge semantic truth or generate wiki prose.
- Validation: `git diff --check`, `py_compile`, `validate-kernel`,
  `fixture-runner`, and `workspace-check --mode fixtures` passed. The ignored
  ADCtoolbox ch2-ch4 workspace now fails at report-check because the old
  compare report lacks the required coverage tables.
- Commit: completed on `main` as `c811361 Harden wiki coverage gate`;
  finalized by the follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Run ADCtoolbox ch2-ch4 hardened redistillation

- Target: test the hardened coverage gate by redistilling the three ADCtoolbox
  PDF decks in a fresh ignored local workspace.
- Changed areas: generated
  `workspace/local/adctoolbox-ch2-ch4-hardened-redistill/` with copied raw
  PDFs, source packets, source/chapter wiki pages, construction analysis,
  compare report, review queue, validation note, and checker reports. Added
  the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-adctoolbox-ch2-ch4-hardened-redistill/`.
- Design review: the new workspace demonstrates the intended strengthened
  loop. The compare report now includes source coverage, page-level anchor
  disposition, and wiki page coverage, so the earlier ch3 shallow-summary
  failure mode is no longer invisible.
- Validation: `workspace-check --mode all` passed for the generated workspace;
  schema, source inventory, source packet, wiki lint, report, closure, and
  fixture checks passed.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `8c10dba Record ADCtoolbox hardened redistillation`; finalized by the
  follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-05 - Minimal formula derivation coverage hardening

- Target: prevent important formula and derivation loss from being treated only
  as nonblocking modality review.
- Changed areas: updated the wiki-round and quality-gate runtime skills,
  `rules/wiki/source-wiki-coverage-protocol.md`, and existing compare and
  validation templates. Added the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-05-minimal-formula-derivation-coverage-hardening/`.
- Design review: this is intentionally minimal. It adds no new schema, checker,
  or separate formula protocol; it clarifies existing coverage semantics so
  accepted wiki knowledge cannot depend on unreadable formulas or derivations
  while still claiming knowledge coverage pass.
- Validation: `git diff --check`, `validate-kernel`, and `fixture-runner`
  passed.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `5fd8ff3 Clarify formula derivation coverage semantics`; finalized by the
  follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-05 - Define workspace topology contract

- Target: close the structural ambiguity between the system repository,
  workspace skeleton, workspace kernel bundle, and live knowledge workspace
  repository.
- Changed areas: added the topology contract and workspace kernel manifest;
  updated system and workspace entry documents, `llm_wiki_tools` guidance,
  kernel validation, and the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-05-workspace-topology-contract/`.
- Design review: `templates/workspace-kernel/` is now explicitly only the
  workspace skeleton. A complete kernel bundle also needs `skills/`, `rules/`,
  `contracts/schemas/`, and checker access. Development tool mode and portable
  tool mode are both named, with portable mode as the long-term transferable
  target.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `python -m llm_wiki_tools validate-kernel` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  the new topology language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `43b83da Define workspace topology contract`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-05 - Complete Person A contract validation closure

- Target: close the current Person A contract, validator, and fixture surface
  as the compact validation substrate before Phase 7.
- Changed areas: added the Person A implementation closure review; hardened
  source packet profile checks and round closure construction-evidence checks;
  extended the fixture runner to execute source validators; added representative
  PPTX/PDF packet fixtures and a missing construction-analysis closure fixture;
  updated testing/tool documentation.
- Design review: this keeps the layer count small. No new schema family was
  added; existing source packet metadata, validation notes, compare/review
  reports, index, log, and fixture-runner evidence are enough for the current
  Person A closure. The tooling validates artifacts rather than becoming an
  extractor harness or wiki generator.
- Validation: `git diff --check`, `validate-kernel`, `schema-check`,
  `fixture-runner`, `workspace-check --mode fixtures`, and targeted `rg`
  passed. Generated smoke reports and Python caches were removed.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `2d56981 Complete Person A contract validation closure`; finalized by the
  follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-05 - Mark repository as failed artifact

- Target: mark the repository as a failed project in the README.
- Changed areas: updated the README failure notice and current-status language;
  added the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-05-mark-repository-failed/`.
- Design review: the edit keeps the repository as historical evidence while
  warning readers not to adopt it as an active workflow or product foundation.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending
  warnings; targeted `rg` confirmed README failure notice language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `6201861 Mark repository as failed artifact`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-05 - Clarify README agent workflow value

- Target: update the README top notice so the repository is framed as a failed
  LLM Wiki attempt with a useful Agent development workflow record.
- Changed areas: updated the README status, failure explanation, and remaining
  value sections; added the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-05-readme-agent-workflow-value/`.
- Design review: the edit distinguishes the failed distillation product from
  the reusable development discipline around `AGENTS.md`, `docs/`, `plan/`,
  validation, logs, and commits.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending
  warnings; targeted `rg` confirmed README status, Agent workflow value, and
  failure-boundary language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `3ec03e4 Clarify README agent workflow value`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.
