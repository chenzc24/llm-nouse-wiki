# chenzc24 Personal Log

This log records personal task outcomes for `chenzc24`.

Repository-wide merged or integration-level maintenance history belongs in
`plan/log.md`.

## 2026-06-22 - Agent workflow kernel extraction

- Target: extract the portable Agent workflow mainline into
  `agent-workflow-kernel/` so plan-log-experience guidance is separated from
  LLM Wiki-specific repository rules.
- Changed areas: added the generic kernel `AGENTS.md`, kernel README, plan
  guidance, starter maintenance log, target-plan template, experience note
  guidance, and lesson template; updated the root README with a discovery
  pointer; added the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-22-agent-workflow-kernel/`.
- Design review: the extracted kernel keeps the transferable discipline:
  target plan, bounded implementation, validation, factual log, optional
  experience note, and commit. Domain-specific terms such as source packets,
  wiki distillation, workspace kernels, and repository submodules were left out
  of the extracted files.
- Validation: targeted `rg` confirmed the new kernel language and found no
  extracted-kernel references to `LLM`, `Wiki`, `source packet`, `distill`,
  `llm_wiki`, `workspace kernel`, or `contracts/schemas`; `git diff --check`
  passed with only Windows line-ending warnings for edited Markdown files.
- Commit: planned as `Extract agent workflow kernel`.

## 2026-06-05 - ADCtoolbox ch1-ch10 density remediation

- Target: fix the shallow-summary failure in the first ch1-ch10 local
  workspace distillation after user review reported that most information was
  omitted.
- Changed areas: regenerated ignored local workspace chapter pages as
  high-density slide-level notes covering 547 page anchors; updated local
  overview, construction analysis, compare report, review queue, validation
  note, wiki log, workspace log, checker reports, and the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-05-adctoolbox-ch1-ch10-density-remediation/`.
- Design review: the wiki layer now preserves extracted lesson text directly
  on each chapter page instead of relying on source packets plus compressed
  summaries. Closure remains `close-with-review` because visual/equation,
  circuit, layout, and measured-plot authority is still unresolved.
- Validation: `python -m llm_wiki_tools workspace-check --workspace
  workspace/local/adctoolbox-adc-basic-ch1-ch10-distill --mode all --report
  workspace/local/adctoolbox-adc-basic-ch1-ch10-distill/.checks/workspace-check-all.md`
  passed.
- Commit: planned as local-workspace maintenance; local workspace artifacts are
  ignored, so only tracked planning/log files are commit candidates.

## 2026-06-05 - ADCtoolbox ch1-ch10 local workspace distillation

- Target: create a fresh ignored local knowledge workspace for ADCtoolbox ADC
  basic course PDFs ch1 through ch10 and run an overview-first first
  distillation round.
- Changed areas: local workspace outputs under
  `workspace/local/adctoolbox-adc-basic-ch1-ch10-distill/`, including raw
  source copies, source inventory, source packets, source/chapter wiki pages,
  construction analysis, compare report, review queue, validation note, and
  checker reports; target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-05-adctoolbox-ch1-ch10-workspace-distill/`.
- Design review: the round covers 547 PDF page anchors across ch1-ch10 and
  closes as text-derived `close-with-review`; visual/equation/circuit/layout
  authority is carried forward as nonblocking review before final engineering
  or executable-spec use.
- Validation: `python -m llm_wiki_tools workspace-check --workspace
  workspace/local/adctoolbox-adc-basic-ch1-ch10-distill --mode all --report
  workspace/local/adctoolbox-adc-basic-ch1-ch10-distill/.checks/workspace-check-all.md`
  passed.
- Commit: planned as local-workspace maintenance; local workspace artifacts are
  ignored, so only tracked planning/log files are commit candidates.

## 2026-06-05 - ADCtoolbox ch4 local PDF redistill

- Target: redistill
  `workspace/local/adctoolbox-ch2-ch4-pdf-distill-test/raw/sources/ADCtoolbox/ADC-basic/ch4.pdf`
  using the current skill-driven, semantic-first, coverage-aware workflow.
- Changed areas: ignored local workspace ch4 packet/wiki/report/check outputs
  under `workspace/local/adctoolbox-ch2-ch4-pdf-distill-test/`, plus the
  target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-05-adctoolbox-ch4-local-pdf-redistill/`.
- Design review: the refreshed ch4 pass fixes the old shallow chapter page,
  records a semantic draft and grounding pass, represents DNL/INL yield,
  binary/segmented worst-case DNL, finite output impedance, and glitch timing,
  and carries exact formula/visual authority as nonblocking review.
- Validation: `python -m llm_wiki_tools workspace-check --workspace
  workspace/local/adctoolbox-ch2-ch4-pdf-distill-test --mode all --report
  workspace/local/adctoolbox-ch2-ch4-pdf-distill-test/.checks/ch4-redistill-workspace-check-all.md`
  passed.
- Commit: planned as local-workspace maintenance; local workspace artifacts are
  ignored, so only tracked planning/log files are commit candidates.

## 2026-06-05 - Refactor workflow toward semantic-first grounding

- Target: correct the workflow direction after real ADCtoolbox PPT/PDF tests
  showed that a source-packet-first process can preserve citations while
  losing formulas, derivations, examples, and dense technical meaning.
- Changed areas: updated current top-level direction docs, runtime skills,
  wiki rules, workspace-kernel guidance, report templates, chapter template,
  and the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-05-semantic-first-audit-grounded-refactor/`.
- Design review: source packets remain required for identity, anchors, gaps,
  and auditability, but they are no longer the semantic ceiling. Wiki
  construction now explicitly routes through semantic draft, grounding pass,
  accepted wiki, compare/review, and closure.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending
  warnings; `python -m llm_wiki_tools validate-kernel` passed;
  `python -m llm_wiki_tools fixture-runner` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  `semantic draft`, `grounding pass`, `audit baseline`, `semantic ceiling`,
  `candidate-derived`, and `semantic richness` language.
- Commit: planned as `Refactor workflow toward semantic-first grounding`.

  personal namespace and remove the misleading executor-agent `codex`
  namespace.
- Changed areas: `plan/users/chenzc24/`, `plan/users/README.md`,
  `plan/README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `plan/log.md`.
- Validation: confirmed no root-level `plan/2026-06-03-*` target plan
  directories remain, `plan/users/codex` does not exist, migrated plans live
  under `plan/users/chenzc24/`, and planning docs distinguish human user
  namespaces from executor agents.
- Commit: ready in the parent repository task.

## 2026-06-03 - Add workspace kernel golden path templates

  `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  the golden-path terms and compare-deferred language; `git submodule status`
  confirmed `llm_wiki` remained pinned.

  owned-file overlap, shared-contract dependency, and plan-note language; `git
  diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings; `git status
  --short --branch` reviewed.
- Commit: ready for `Relax dirty worktree policy for parallel work`.

## 2026-06-03 - ADCtoolbox ch1 PDF dry run

- Changed areas: `.gitignore`,
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-03-adctoolbox-ch1-pdf-dry-run/`, and ignored
  local files under `workspace/local/adctoolbox-ch1-dry-run/`.
- Validation: copied PDF and wiki output were ignored by `.gitignore`;
  metadata JSON parsed; targeted `rg` confirmed source anchors and
  compare-deferred language; dry-run workspace produced source inventory,
  source packet, wiki pages, rendered visual review images, and validation
  note.
- Commit: completed and pushed to `origin/main` as `d32621d Add ignored
  workspace dry run area`.

## 2026-06-04 - Reframe Phase 2 as packet protocol

- Target: adjust Phase 2 wording and Person A/B guidance so Phase 2 is
  protocol-first: optional agents, MCPs, local CLIs, MinerU, or custom
  extractors may be used, but they must produce the workspace source packet
  protocol rather than owning the workflow.

- Target: execute and review Person B Phase 3 by defining the
  source-packet-to-evidence and evidence-to-claim workflow surface, including
  generated-evidence review routing and artifact-economy boundaries.
- Changed areas: added
  `docs/phase-plans/phase-3-evidence-claim-workflow.md`,
  `docs/phase-plans/phase-3-closure-review.md`,
  `rules/source-packet-to-evidence.md`, `rules/evidence-to-claim.md`,
  `rules/claim-review-routing.md`,
  `templates/workspace-kernel/reports/claim-evidence-map.template.md`, and
  `templates/workspace-kernel/reports/review-queue.template.md`; updated
  Phase 2/3 phase-plan indexes, Phase 3 handoff rules, workspace kernel
  templates, and `tools/claim-audit/README.md`; added the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-3-evidence-claim-workflow/`.
- Design review: Phase 3 keeps claim/evidence as an audit and review layer,
  preserves source/chapter-oriented wiki readability, avoids model
  self-evaluation, preserves generated-evidence visibility, and leaves
  `contracts/schemas/**` to Person A.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed; all
  `contracts/schemas/*.schema.json` parsed with `ConvertFrom-Json`; targeted
  `rg` confirmed Source Packet To Evidence, Evidence To Claim, Claim Review
  Routing, generated evidence, review item, artifact economy,
  source/chapter, claim-audit, not a wiki page, and Phase 3 language; `git
  submodule status` confirmed `MinerU/` and `llm_wiki/` remained pinned.
- Commit: completed on `main` as `4465b0a Define phase three evidence claim
  workflow`; finalized by the follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Define phase four wiki page routing

- Target: start Person B Phase 4.1 by defining wiki page routing and the
  default reading surface before source/chapter template hardening.
- Changed areas: added
  `docs/phase-plans/phase-4-wiki-construction-engine.md` and
  `rules/wiki-page-routing.md`; updated `docs/phase-plans/README.md`,
  `rules/README.md`, `rules/source-packet-to-wiki.md`,
  `rules/wiki-index-contract.md`, and workspace wiki index/overview/source
  and chapter guidance; added the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-4-1-wiki-page-routing/`.
- Design review: Phase 4.1 keeps `wiki/chapters/*` as the primary distilled
  knowledge surface, keeps `wiki/sources/*` as short source notes rather than
  second source packets, keeps claim/evidence maps in reports, and keeps
  optional synthesis/research pages deferred unless the corpus needs them.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  Wiki Page Routing, source page, chapter page, overview, index,
  claim/evidence, not a second source packet, Optional Synthesis, optional
  research, and Phase 4.1 language; `git submodule status` confirmed
  `MinerU/` and `llm_wiki/` remained pinned.
- Commit: completed on `main` as `ee450aa Define phase four wiki page
  routing`; finalized by the follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Harden phase four source chapter templates

- Target: execute Person B Phase 4.2 by hardening source and chapter page
  templates and adding a wiki construction analysis surface between routing and
  page generation.
- Changed areas: added
  `docs/phase-plans/phase-4.2-source-chapter-template-hardening.md` and
  `templates/workspace-kernel/reports/wiki-construction-analysis.template.md`;
  updated `docs/phase-plans/phase-4-wiki-construction-engine.md`,
  `docs/phase-plans/README.md`, `rules/source-packet-to-wiki.md`,
  `rules/wiki-page-routing.md`, workspace reports/schema guidance, source and
  chapter README files, and source/chapter page templates; added the target
  plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-4-2-source-chapter-template-hardening/`.
- Design review: source pages remain short source notes, chapter pages remain
  the primary distilled knowledge surface, construction analysis records
  routing/merge/review decisions before generation, and claim/evidence maps
  stay in reports rather than page bodies.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  Phase 4.2, wiki construction analysis, source page, chapter page, packet
  reference, claim/evidence, review handoff, not a source packet, not a
  claim/evidence table, Construction Inputs, and Generated Or Uncertain
  Evidence language; `git submodule status` confirmed `MinerU/` and
  `llm_wiki/` remained pinned.
- Commit: completed on `main` as `dd490d4 Harden phase four source chapter
  templates`; finalized by the follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Define phase four wiki construction round protocol

- Target: execute Person B Phase 4.3 by defining the repeatable wiki
  construction round protocol for fixed inputs, routing, construction analysis,
  page create/update/merge decisions, index/log updates, validation notes, and
  review carry-forward.
- Changed areas: added
  `docs/phase-plans/phase-4.3-wiki-construction-round-protocol.md`; updated
  `docs/phase-plans/phase-4-wiki-construction-engine.md`,
  `docs/phase-plans/README.md`, `rules/distillation-rounds.md`,
  `rules/source-packet-to-wiki.md`, workspace README and AGENTS guidance,
  first-round plan and validation note templates, wiki construction analysis
  template, and `wiki/log.md`; added the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-4-3-wiki-construction-round-protocol/`.
- Design review: Phase 4.3 keeps wiki construction incremental and auditable:
  rounds must fix inputs, route pages, write construction analysis before
  generation, update index/log for accepted page changes, and carry unresolved
  review forward without treating a missing compare gate as pass.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  Phase 4.3, wiki construction round, fixed input set, routing decision,
  construction analysis, create/update/merge, index/log, validation note,
  review carry-forward, carried forward, and `compare gate not enabled`
  language; `git submodule status` confirmed `MinerU/` and `llm_wiki/`
  remained pinned.
- Commit: completed on `main` as `41cb2b5 Define phase four wiki construction
  round protocol`; finalized by the follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Define phase four overview index log maintenance

- Target: continue Person B Phase 4.4 by defining how wiki overview, index,
  and log artifacts stay synchronized across wiki construction rounds.
- Changed areas: added
  `docs/phase-plans/phase-4.4-overview-index-log-maintenance.md` and
  `rules/wiki-overview-log-contract.md`; updated the main Phase 4 plan,
  phase-plan and rule indexes, `distillation-rounds`,
  `source-packet-to-wiki`, `wiki-index-contract`, workspace AGENTS guidance,
  overview/index/log templates, overview template, and first-round validation
  note template; added the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-4-4-overview-index-log-maintenance/`.
- Design review: Phase 4.4 keeps `wiki/overview.md` as the current corpus map
  and reading path, `wiki/index.md` as a navigation contract, and
  `wiki/log.md` as a short chronological event record. Overview/index/log
  maintenance is required during wiki construction, but these files do not
  become final synthesis, claim/evidence maps, or validation reports.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  Phase 4.4, overview refresh, index integrity, wiki log, navigation contract,
  stale entries, not a final synthesis, not knowledge prose, no-change reason,
  and refresh reason language; `git submodule status` confirmed `MinerU/` and
  `llm_wiki/` remained pinned.
- Commit: completed on `main` as `02e0fbb Define phase four overview index
  log maintenance`; finalized by the follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Close phase four wiki construction workflow

- Target: execute Person B Phase 4.5 by closing the Phase 4 wiki construction
  workflow surface and recording the Person A validation handoff.
- Changed areas: added
  `docs/phase-plans/phase-4-closure-review.md`; updated
  `docs/phase-plans/phase-4-wiki-construction-engine.md` and
  `docs/phase-plans/README.md`; added the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-4-5-closure-review/`.
- Design review: Phase 4 is complete from the Person B workflow-surface side:
  source/chapter-oriented wiki construction now has routing, construction
  analysis, page create/update/merge decisions, overview/index/log
  maintenance, validation note expectations, and explicit Person A handoff for
  deterministic validation.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  Phase 4 Closure, Person A Handoff, complete from the Person B
  workflow-surface side, wiki construction, overview, index, log, frontmatter,
  broken link, and Phase 5 language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as `460f014 Close phase four wiki construction
  workflow`; finalized by the follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Define phase five compare report foundation

- Target: start Person B Phase 5.1 by defining the compare gate report
  foundation for raw-wiki alignment and round advancement decisions.
- Changed areas: added
  `docs/phase-plans/phase-5-compare-gates-review-workflow.md`,
  `docs/phase-plans/phase-5.1-compare-report-foundation.md`, and
  `templates/workspace-kernel/reports/compare-report.template.md`; expanded
  `rules/compare-gate-contract.md`; updated `docs/phase-plans/README.md`,
  workspace reports README, review queue template, first-round validation note
  template, and the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-5-1-compare-report-foundation/`.
- Design review: Phase 5.1 keeps compare gates report-centered and
  anti-self-evaluation oriented: one default compare report records source
  coverage, claim coverage, modality coverage, link/index/overview/log checks,
  omissions, contradictions, review items, carried-forward review, and
  `pass`/`fail`/`needs-review` status without rewriting wiki pages or starting
  downstream `skill + tool` work.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  Phase 5, Compare Gate, Compare Report, raw-wiki alignment, source coverage,
  claim coverage, modality coverage, pass, fail, needs-review, model
  self-evaluation, carried forward, and wiki rewrite boundary language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as `2233f28 Define phase five compare report
  foundation`; finalized by the follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Define phase five source wiki coverage protocol

- Target: continue Person B Phase 5.2 by defining source/wiki coverage,
  anchor disposition, omission, deferral, weak coverage, and scope-exclusion
  semantics for compare reports.
- Changed areas: added
  `docs/phase-plans/phase-5.2-source-wiki-coverage-omission-protocol.md` and
  `rules/source-wiki-coverage-protocol.md`; updated the main Phase 5 plan,
  phase-plan and rule indexes, `rules/compare-gate-contract.md`, workspace
  reports README, compare report template, first-round validation note
  template, and the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-5-2-source-wiki-coverage-omission/`.
- Design review: Phase 5.2 keeps coverage as source disposition rather than
  source copying. Compare reports can now record `covered`, `weak`,
  `deferred`, `omitted`, `out-of-scope`, `review`, and `blocked` states for
  source packets, anchors, and wiki pages while preserving the default
  source/chapter wiki surface and avoiding default report sprawl.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  Phase 5.2, Source Wiki Coverage, source/wiki coverage, anchor disposition,
  covered, weak, omitted, deferred, out-of-scope, scope exclusion, Coverage is
  not copying, report sprawl, and source-wiki-coverage-protocol language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as `c7f6070 Define phase five source wiki
  coverage protocol`; finalized by the follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Define phase five claim modality review protocol

- Target: continue Person B Phase 5.3 by defining claim support, generated
  evidence, modality coverage, unsupported statement, contradiction, and
  semantic review semantics for compare reports.
- Changed areas: added
  `docs/phase-plans/phase-5.3-claim-modality-contradiction-review-protocol.md`
  and `rules/claim-modality-contradiction-review-protocol.md`; updated the
  main Phase 5 plan, phase-plan and rule indexes, `rules/compare-gate-contract.md`,
  workspace compare report template, claim/evidence map template, review queue
  template, first-round validation note template, and the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-5-3-claim-modality-contradiction-review/`.
- Design review: Phase 5.3 keeps compare gates from accepting clean prose as
  proof. Important claims now need support, review, or not-in-scope status;
  generated evidence and modality interpretations remain visible; unsupported
  statements and contradictions become compare findings rather than silent wiki
  edits.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  Phase 5.3, Claim Modality Contradiction, claim support, generated evidence,
  modality coverage, unsupported statement, contradiction, source-derived,
  reviewed-generated, semantic review, and not-a-claim-audit-tool language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as `8d2958b Define phase five claim modality
  review protocol`; finalized by the follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Define phase five review queue workflow

- Target: continue Person B Phase 5.4 by defining review queue lifecycle,
  blocking levels, resolution, dismissal, stale, carried-forward, and re-entry
  semantics for compare rounds.
- Changed areas: added
  `docs/phase-plans/phase-5.4-review-queue-carry-forward-workflow.md` and
  `rules/review-queue-workflow.md`; updated the main Phase 5 plan,
  phase-plan and rule indexes, `rules/compare-gate-contract.md`, workspace
  reports README, compare report template, review queue template,
  first-round validation note template, and the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-5-4-review-queue-carry-forward/`.
- Design review: Phase 5.4 keeps unresolved judgment visible across rounds.
  Review items now have explicit lifecycle status, blocking level, resolution
  and dismissal rules, stale detection, and carry-forward requirements instead
  of disappearing after a single compare report.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  Phase 5.4, Review Queue, carried-forward, blocking, nonblocking, resolved,
  dismissed, stale, re-enter, review lifecycle, and not-a-review-export-tool
  language; reference submodules remained pinned.
- Commit: completed on `main` as `65fff4a Define phase five review queue
  workflow`; finalized by the follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Define phase five round closure workflow

- Target: continue Person B Phase 5.5 by defining round closure integration
  across compare status, review state, validation notes, `wiki/index.md`,
  `wiki/overview.md`, and `wiki/log.md`.
- Changed areas: added
  `docs/phase-plans/phase-5.5-round-closure-integration.md` and
  `rules/round-closure-workflow.md`; updated the main Phase 5 plan,
  phase-plan and rule indexes, `rules/compare-gate-contract.md`,
  `rules/distillation-rounds.md`, `rules/wiki-overview-log-contract.md`,
  workspace reports README, compare report template, first-round validation
  note template, wiki index template, wiki overview template, wiki log
  template, and the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-5-5-round-closure-integration/`.
- Design review: Phase 5.5 keeps round closure as an integration decision over
  existing artifacts rather than a new report family. Rounds now close as
  `close-pass`, `close-with-review`, or `do-not-close` based on compare,
  review, validation, index, overview, and wiki log state.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  Phase 5.5, Round Closure, round can close, close with review, must not
  close, advance with review, closure packet, validation note, index,
  overview, wiki log, and not-a-validator-implementation language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as `32aff4f Define phase five round closure
  workflow`; finalized by the follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Close phase five compare gate workflow

- Target: close Phase 5 from the Person B workflow-surface side by reviewing
  the complete compare gates and review workflow and handing schema,
  validator, fixture, and tool needs to Person A or Phase 6.
- Changed areas: added `docs/phase-plans/phase-5-closure-review.md`; updated
  the main Phase 5 plan, phase-plan index, and target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-5-6-closure-review/`.
- Design review: Phase 5 now has a closed workflow surface for compare report
  foundation, source/wiki coverage, claim/modality/contradiction checks,
  review queue lifecycle, and round closure. Phase 6 is explicitly scoped as
  validation and tooling for the workspace kernel, not downstream
  knowledge-to-`skill + tool` generation.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  Phase 5 Closure, Phase 5 is complete, compare gates, review workflow,
  close-pass, close-with-review, do-not-close, Person A handoff, Phase 6, and
  not-implement language; reference submodules remained pinned.
- Commit: completed on `main` as `9e3aad0 Close phase five compare gate
  workflow`; finalized by the follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Rebaseline phase six as validation tooling

- Target: rebaseline Phase 6 after the no-harness decision so it is defined as
  workspace validation and checker tooling rather than source packet extractor
  orchestration.
- Changed areas: added
  `docs/phase-plans/phase-6-validation-tooling-rebaseline.md`; updated the
  top-level architecture, execution roadmap, phase-plan index, Phase 2 tool
  surface references, collaboration guidance, tool README, source packet
  convert README, and the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-6-0-validation-tooling-rebaseline/`.
- Design review: Phase 6 now validates workspace artifacts and source packet
  outputs produced by humans, agents, MCPs, optional extractors, or custom
  scripts. It does not run MinerU, wrap MCP extractors, run OCR/VLM, implement
  a PDF/PPTX/DOCX parser harness, or start downstream knowledge-to-`skill +
  tool` work.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  Phase 6.0, Validation Tooling, checker, not-a-harness, does-not-run-extractors,
  source-packet-outputs, workspace-artifacts, and Phase 7 boundary language;
  reference submodules remained pinned.
- Commit: completed on `main` as `0e68250 Rebaseline phase six as validation
  tooling`; finalized by the follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Add phase six tool runtime skeleton

- Target: start Phase 6.1 by adding a checker-first runtime skeleton and
  shared report/exit-code conventions for future workspace validators.
- Changed areas: added `docs/phase-plans/phase-6.1-tool-runtime-skeleton.md`,
  `tools/shared/README.md`, `tools/shared/report-conventions.md`,
  `tools/workspace-check/README.md`, `tools/workspace-check/workspace-check.ps1`,
  and the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-6-1-tool-runtime-skeleton/`; updated
  the Phase 6 rebaseline plan, phase-plan index, and tools README.
- Design review: Phase 6.1 establishes the runnable checker shell without
  implementing business validators. `workspace-check` validates runtime inputs,
  emits a stable Markdown report, reports future validators as
  `not-implemented`, and does not run extractors or parse raw binaries.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed; `workspace-check.ps1`
  smoke run against `.` passed and generated a temporary report that was
  removed; direct missing-workspace smoke produced an internal error report
  with exit code `3`; targeted `rg` confirmed Phase 6.1, workspace-check,
  report-conventions, exit-code, not-implemented, does-not-run-extractors, and
  checker language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as `990f384 Add phase six tool runtime
  skeleton`; finalized by the follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Add phase six schema checker

- Target: implement Phase 6.2 schema and structured-field validation as the
  first real checker in the Phase 6 validation tooling layer.
- Changed areas: added
  `docs/phase-plans/phase-6.2-schema-structured-field-validation.md`,
  `tools/schema-check/README.md`, and `tools/schema-check/schema-check.ps1`;
  aligned source inventory, source packet, claim record, compare report, and
  review item schemas with stable workflow fields and enums; integrated
  `schema-check` into `workspace-check -Mode schemas`; updated `validate-kernel`
  required paths, Phase 6 rebaseline docs, phase-plan index, tool READMEs, and
  the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-6-2-schema-structured-field-validation/`.
- Design review: Phase 6.2 validates reusable schema contracts, not workspace
  instances. It is not a JSON Schema engine, does not validate source packet
  directories, and does not run extractors.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed; `schema-check.ps1`
  smoke run passed; `workspace-check.ps1 -Mode schemas` passed and invoked
  schema-check; generated smoke reports were removed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  Phase 6.2, schema-check, structured-field, source-packet-output,
  not-a-JSON-Schema-engine, does-not-validate-workspace-instances, and
  does-not-run-extractors language; reference submodules remained pinned.
- Commit: completed on `main` as `b3e2c37 Add phase six schema checker`;
  finalized by the follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Add phase six source artifact checkers

- Target: implement Phase 6.3 source inventory and source packet output
  validators as checker-only workspace artifact tooling.
- Changed areas: added
  `docs/phase-plans/phase-6.3-source-artifact-checkers.md`;
  implemented `tools/source-inventory/source-inventory-check.ps1` and
  `tools/source-packet-lint/source-packet-lint.ps1`; integrated source checks
  into `workspace-check -Mode source`; updated Phase 6 docs, tool READMEs,
  `validate-kernel`, and the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-6-3-source-artifact-checkers/`.
- Design review: Phase 6.3 validates existing inventory and packet artifacts.
  It does not create inventory rows, generate packets, run extractors, parse
  raw binary documents, or perform semantic truth review.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed; temporary smoke
  workspace under the OS temp directory passed `source-inventory-check.ps1`,
  `source-packet-lint.ps1`, and `workspace-check.ps1 -Mode source`; targeted
  `rg` confirmed Phase 6.3, source-inventory-check, source-packet-lint,
  no-extractor, and source artifact language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `30f7cf1 Add phase six source artifact checkers`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Close phase six validation tooling

- Target: close Phase 6 with a final checker-surface review and Phase 7
  boundary statement.
- Changed areas: added `docs/phase-plans/phase-6-closure-review.md`; updated
  the Phase 6 main plan, phase-plan index, tool README, and target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-6-8-closure-review/`.
- Design review: Phase 6 is closed as a checker-first maintenance layer. It
  validates existing workspace artifacts and fixture scenarios; it does not
  run extractors, parse raw binary documents, generate source packets or wiki
  pages, resolve semantic review, or start downstream `skill + tool` work.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending
  warnings; `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed;
  `schema-check.ps1` passed; `fixture-runner.ps1` passed the Phase 6 fixture
  scenarios; `workspace-check.ps1 -Mode fixtures` passed and invoked fixture
  validation; generated smoke reports were removed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  closure, checker-first, no-extractor-harness, no-semantic-review,
  system-repo, fixture-runner, and Phase 7 boundary language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `12baac7 Close phase six validation tooling`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Migrate phase six tooling to Python CLI

- Target: refactor implemented Phase 6 checker tools from PowerShell scripts
  to a Python CLI runtime without keeping `.ps1` compatibility wrappers.
- Changed areas: added `pyproject.toml` and `llm_wiki_tools/`; ported
  `validate-kernel`, `schema-check`, `source-inventory-check`,
  `source-packet-lint`, `wiki-lint`, `report-check`, `round-closure-check`,
  `fixture-runner`, and `workspace-check`; deleted implemented `.ps1` scripts;
  updated tool READMEs, Phase 6 docs, tests docs, and the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-6-9-python-tooling-runtime/`.
- Design review: the runtime is now portable Python CLI while preserving the
  checker-first boundary. It still does not run extractors, parse raw binary
  sources, generate source packets or wiki pages, resolve semantic review, or
  start downstream `skill + tool` work.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending
  warnings; `python -m py_compile` passed for the package entry files;
  `python -m llm_wiki_tools validate-kernel` passed; `schema-check` passed;
  `fixture-runner` passed the Phase 6 fixtures; `workspace-check --mode
  fixtures` passed; generated smoke reports were removed; `rg` confirmed no
  `.ps1` tool files remain and active command docs use Python CLI commands.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `735a4da Migrate phase six tooling to Python CLI`; finalized by the
  follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Add Person B workflow closure review

- Target: review whether Person B still needs to define source packet profiles
  or wiki construction workflow, and clarify the Person A handoff.
- Changed areas: added
  `docs/collaboration/person-b-workflow-closure-review.md`; updated
  `docs/collaboration/README.md`; added the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-person-b-workflow-closure-review/`.
- Design review: Person B has already defined the core source packet profile
  and wiki construction workflow surfaces. The remaining high-value work is
  Person A source packet fixtures, wiki construction fixtures, validator
  hardening, and end-to-end scenarios. Extractor harnesses and deterministic
  wiki generation remain out of scope.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending
  warnings; `python -m llm_wiki_tools validate-kernel` passed; targeted `rg`
  confirmed source packet profile, wiki construction, Person A handoff,
  extractor-harness, wiki-generator, fixture, validator-hardening, and Person B
  workflow-surface language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `c27ee85 Add person B workflow closure review`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Add phase six wiki lint checker

- Target: implement Phase 6.4 wiki lint and navigation validation for existing
  workspace wiki artifacts.
- Changed areas: added
  `docs/phase-plans/phase-6.4-wiki-lint-navigation.md`; implemented
  `tools/wiki-lint/wiki-lint.ps1`; integrated wiki lint into
  `workspace-check -Mode wiki`; updated Phase 6 docs, tool READMEs,
  `validate-kernel`, and the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-6-4-wiki-lint-navigation/`.
- Design review: Phase 6.4 validates special wiki files, frontmatter, links,
  index membership, overview sections, and log dated headings. It does not
  generate pages, rewrite links, run compare gates, or resolve semantic review.
- Validation: temporary smoke workspace under the OS temp directory passed
  `wiki-lint.ps1` and `workspace-check.ps1 -Mode wiki`; `git diff --check`
  passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  Phase 6.4, wiki-lint, Mode wiki, index membership, broken links,
  no-page-generation, no-link-rewrite, and semantic-review language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as `7541178 Add phase six wiki lint checker`;
  finalized by the follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Add phase six report surface checker

- Target: implement Phase 6.5 report surface validation for compare reports,
  claim/evidence maps, review queues, and validation notes.
- Changed areas: added
  `docs/phase-plans/phase-6.5-report-surface-checker.md`; implemented
  `tools/report-check/report-check.ps1`; integrated report checking into
  `workspace-check -Mode reports`; updated Phase 6 docs, tool READMEs,
  `validate-kernel`, and the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-6-5-report-surface-checker/`.
- Design review: Phase 6.5 validates Markdown report structure, status
  vocabulary, obvious pass/blocker consistency, supported-claim evidence IDs,
  review lifecycle fields, and validation-note closure fields. It does not
  extract claims, decide semantic truth, rewrite reports, generate wiki pages,
  or close rounds.
- Validation: temporary smoke workspace under the OS temp directory passed
  `report-check.ps1` and `workspace-check.ps1 -Mode reports`; `git diff
  --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  Phase 6.5, report-check, Mode reports, compare report, review queue,
  claim/evidence, validation note, no-claim-extraction, and no-semantic-truth
  language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `6151b30 Add phase six report surface checker`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Add phase six round closure checker

- Target: implement Phase 6.6 round closure consistency validation.
- Changed areas: added
  `docs/phase-plans/phase-6.6-round-closure-checker.md`; implemented
  `tools/round-closure-check/round-closure-check.ps1`; integrated closure
  checking into `workspace-check -Mode closure`; updated Phase 6 docs, tool
  READMEs, `validate-kernel`, and the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-6-6-round-closure-checker/`.
- Design review: Phase 6.6 validates recorded closure decisions against
  validation note fields, compare status, review queue references, index/log
  visibility, and active report discoverability. It does not close rounds,
  rewrite notes, resolve review, decide semantic truth, or generate reports.
- Validation: temporary smoke workspace under the OS temp directory passed
  `round-closure-check.ps1` and `workspace-check.ps1 -Mode closure`; `git diff
  --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  Phase 6.6, round-closure-check, Mode closure, close-pass,
  close-with-review, do-not-close, validation note, no-round-closing, and
  no-semantic-truth language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `5878219 Add phase six round closure checker`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Add phase six fixture runner

- Target: implement Phase 6.7 scenario fixture runner and minimum pass, fail,
  and needs-review scenarios for Phase 6 checker behavior.
- Changed areas: added `docs/phase-plans/phase-6.7-fixture-runner.md`;
  implemented `tools/fixture-runner/fixture-runner.ps1`; added fixture
  scenarios under `tests/fixtures/phase6/`; integrated fixture running into
  `workspace-check -Mode fixtures`; updated Phase 6 docs, tool READMEs, test
  docs, `validate-kernel`, and the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-phase-6-7-fixture-runner/`.
- Design review: Phase 6.7 validates checker behavior on small, copied
  fixture workspaces. It does not run extractors, parse raw binary documents,
  generate source packets or wiki pages, or resolve semantic review.
- Validation: `fixture-runner.ps1` passed the minimum pass/fail/needs-review
  scenarios; `workspace-check.ps1 -Mode fixtures` passed and invoked the
  fixture runner; generated smoke reports were removed; `git diff --check`
  passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `tools/validate-kernel/validate-kernel.ps1` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  Phase 6.7, fixture-runner, Mode fixtures, pass/fail/needs-review,
  no-extractor, no-semantic-review, and scenario language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `b3962af Add phase six fixture runner`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Consolidate rules progressive disclosure

- Target: reorganize `rules/` into a progressive-disclosure rule map with
  clear entrypoints, semantic owner documents, and compatibility entries for
  historical links.
- Changed areas: rewrote `rules/README.md`; added
  `rules/evidence-claim-workflow.md` and `rules/wiki-surface-workflow.md`;
  converted historical Phase 3 and Phase 4 split files into compatibility
  entries; reduced duplicate semantic tables in `rules/compare-gate-contract.md`;
  updated `rules/source-packet-to-wiki.md`, workspace-kernel guidance,
  `llm_wiki_tools` kernel validation, top-level rules guidance, and the target
  plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-rules-progressive-disclosure-consolidation/`.
- Design review: the rules now expose the default path as maintenance, round,
  source packet, wiki, compare, and closure before specialized modules. The
  semantic owner map keeps coverage, review lifecycle, claim/modality, evidence
  and claim, and wiki surface definitions in one owner file each while old
  links remain valid.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `python -m llm_wiki_tools validate-kernel` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  `Default Golden Path`, `When To Read More`, `Semantic Ownership`,
  compatibility entries, `evidence-claim-workflow`, `wiki-surface-workflow`,
  and reduced compare-gate duplicate tables.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `e4b6da2 Consolidate rules progressive disclosure`; finalized by the
  follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Add agent skill entrypoints

- Target: add Agent-facing workflow entrypoints and define the boundary between
  docs, rules, and skills.
- Changed areas: updated `AGENTS.md` to state that `docs/` are maintenance and
  design records, `rules/` are the semantic source of truth, and `skills/` are
  the Agent routing layer; added `llm-wiki-distill`, `llm-wiki-source-packet`,
  `llm-wiki-wiki-round`, and `llm-wiki-quality-gate` skills; updated
  `llm_wiki_tools` kernel validation; added the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-agent-skill-entrypoints/`.
- Design review: the end-to-end workflow is now exposed as a skill entrypoint
  instead of a `docs/` workflow page. Skills route agents to rules and
  subskills without copying rule semantics.
- Validation: skill quick validation passed for all four skills; targeted `rg`
  confirmed no TODO placeholders and confirmed docs/rules/skills boundary
  language; `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `python -m llm_wiki_tools validate-kernel` passed.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `d8860b7 Add agent skill entrypoints`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Prepare Person A dry-run v2 handoff

- Target: create a current-system local `adctoolbox-ch1-dry-run-v2` workspace
  from the same historical ADCtoolbox chapter material and clarify Person A's
  checker ownership.
- Changed areas: created ignored local workspace output under
  `workspace/local/adctoolbox-ch1-dry-run-v2/`; added
  `docs/collaboration/person-a-dry-run-v2-review-brief.md`; updated
  collaboration ownership docs and the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-person-a-dry-run-v2-handoff/`.
- Design review: v2 follows the current source/chapter default and intentionally
  omits old research-profile directories. Person A should derive fixtures,
  schemas, and validator expectations from v2 rather than rewriting Person B's
  workflow prose.
- Validation: `python -m llm_wiki_tools workspace-check --workspace
  workspace/local/adctoolbox-ch1-dry-run-v2 --mode all --report
  workspace/local/adctoolbox-ch1-dry-run-v2/reports/workspace-check-v2.md`
  passed after copying `contracts/schemas/**` into the local workspace;
  `git diff --check`, `python -m llm_wiki_tools validate-kernel`, and targeted
  `rg` passed during final commit validation.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `845ce1a Clarify person A validation handoff`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Collapse tool docs into Python package

- Target: remove root-level `tools/` as a standalone documentation directory
  and move the concise checker command index into `llm_wiki_tools/README.md`.
- Changed areas: added `llm_wiki_tools/README.md`; updated kernel validation in
  `llm_wiki_tools/cli.py`; removed root-level `tools/**` README/spec files;
  updated current-facing repository, architecture, collaboration, and Phase 6
  references.
- Design review: the runnable implementation and command index now share the
  same package. `rules/**` continues to own workflow semantics, while
  `docs/phase-plans/**` remains historical planning rather than tool manuals.
- Validation: `python -m py_compile llm_wiki_tools/cli.py
  llm_wiki_tools/__main__.py` passed; `python -m llm_wiki_tools
  validate-kernel` passed; root-level `tools/` no longer exists.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `d480ae2 Collapse tool docs into Python package`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Slim duplicate rules prose

- Target: reduce duplicated explanatory prose in the largest rule owner
  documents while preserving the distillation workflow, safety gates, and
  compatibility paths.
- Changed areas: rewrote
  `rules/raw-to-source-packet.md`, `rules/distillation-rounds.md`,
  `rules/source-packet-to-wiki.md`, `rules/wiki-surface-workflow.md`,
  `rules/evidence-claim-workflow.md`, and `rules/compare-gate-contract.md`;
  added the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-rules-slimming-pass/`.
- Design review: the rules now emphasize minimum path, semantic ownership, and
  handoff boundaries. Repeated page-surface, closure, review, and coverage
  explanations were replaced with owner-rule references; required fields,
  statuses, forbidden shortcuts, and acceptance criteria remain present.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `python -m llm_wiki_tools validate-kernel` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  `source inventory`, `<source_id>#<anchor_id>`,
  `wiki construction analysis`, `compare gate not enabled`, `close-pass`,
  `needs-review`, and `review item`; the six edited rule files were reduced by
  424 net lines.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `1f0408e Slim duplicate rules prose`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Remove rules compatibility stubs

- Target: delete obsolete `rules/` compatibility stub files after the semantic
  owner rules became the current entrypoints.
- Changed areas: removed the source-packet-to-evidence, evidence-to-claim,
  claim-review-routing, wiki-page-routing, wiki-index-contract, and
  wiki-overview-log-contract stub files; updated `rules/README.md`,
  `llm_wiki_tools/cli.py`, current Person B collaboration guidance, and the
  target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-remove-rules-compatibility-stubs/`.
- Design review: no workflow semantics were removed. Evidence/claim semantics
  remain owned by `rules/evidence-claim-workflow.md`; wiki surface semantics
  remain owned by `rules/wiki-surface-workflow.md`; historical phase plans and
  logs were left as historical records.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `python -m llm_wiki_tools validate-kernel` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  the deleted stub paths are no longer referenced by current rules, tools,
  skills, templates, agent guidance, README, or collaboration docs; `Test-Path`
  confirmed all six stub files are absent.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `6e4d03a Remove obsolete rule compatibility stubs`; finalized by the
  follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Group rules by workflow area

- Target: restructure `rules/` from a flat list into progressive-disclosure
  subdirectories without changing rule semantics.
- Changed areas: moved owner rules into `rules/workflow/`, `rules/source/`,
  `rules/wiki/`, `rules/claims/`, and `rules/review/`; updated
  `rules/README.md`, repo README, top-level rules guidance, current
  collaboration references, Agent skills, and `llm_wiki_tools` kernel
  validation; added the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-rules-directory-restructure/`.
- Design review: the default golden path now lives visibly under
  `rules/workflow/`, while optional source, wiki, claim, and review modules
  are separated by audience and use. Historical phase plans and old plan/log
  references were left as historical records.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `python -m llm_wiki_tools validate-kernel` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  current-facing files no longer reference old flat rule paths or bare old rule
  filenames; `rg --files rules` confirmed the new grouped layout.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `a016187 Group rules by workflow area`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Consolidate workflow runtime into skills

- Target: complete the three-stage skill runtime consolidation: rewrite skills
  as runtime cards, review parity against `rules/workflow/**`, and remove the
  old workflow-rule runtime entrypoints after review.
- Changed areas: expanded the four `skills/**/SKILL.md` runtime cards and
  OpenAI metadata; added
  `docs/collaboration/skill-runtime-vs-workflow-rules-review.md`; updated
  current README, architecture, collaboration docs, `rules/README.md`, and
  `llm_wiki_tools` kernel validation; deleted `rules/workflow/**`; added the
  target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-skill-runtime-consolidation-stage-3/`.
- Design review: `skills/` now owns workflow guidance, runtime, and
  progressive disclosure. `rules/` is a detailed source/wiki/claim/review
  reference layer, schemas and tools own machine-checkable contracts, and
  historical plan/log references were left intact.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending
  warnings; `python -m py_compile llm_wiki_tools/cli.py
  llm_wiki_tools/__main__.py` passed; `python -m llm_wiki_tools
  validate-kernel` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed skill runtime,
  progressive-disclosure, source packet, wiki construction analysis,
  `close-pass`, and detailed rule references; `rules/workflow` references are
  limited to the migration review and historical wording, and the local
  `rules/workflow` directory is absent.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `eef4fc6 Consolidate workflow runtime into skills`; finalized by the
  follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Run ADCtoolbox ch2-ch4 PDF distillation test

- Target: create a new ignored local workspace for ADCtoolbox ch2, ch3, and
  ch4 PDF course decks and test the current source-packet, wiki, report, and
  closure workflow.
- Changed areas: generated local workspace
  `workspace/local/adctoolbox-ch2-ch4-pdf-distill-test/`; copied `ch2.pdf`,
  `ch3.pdf`, and `ch4.pdf`; created source inventory, three source packets,
  source/chapter wiki pages, overview, index, wiki log, construction analysis,
  compare report, review queue, validation note, and checker reports under
  `.checks/`; added the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-adctoolbox-ch2-ch4-pdf-distill-test/`.
- Design review: the workflow can handle real PDF lecture decks as an ignored
  local workspace. Text extraction with `pypdf` is enough for first-pass
  source packets and chapter wiki pages, but the round correctly closes as
  `close-with-review` because plots, equations, circuits, and slide layout
  still require visual review before final technical use.
- Validation: `python -m llm_wiki_tools workspace-check --workspace
  workspace/local/adctoolbox-ch2-ch4-pdf-distill-test --mode all --report
  workspace/local/adctoolbox-ch2-ch4-pdf-distill-test/.checks/workspace-check-all.md`
  passed. Schema, source inventory, source packet, wiki lint, report, closure,
  and fixture checks passed.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `1883a3f Record ADCtoolbox ch2-ch4 distillation test`; finalized by the
  follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Refresh README and archive old concept note

- Target: update the root README as the current Person B-facing system
  entrypoint, archive root `llm-wiki.md`, and delete the obsolete root
  workspace divergence note.
- Changed areas: rewrote `README.md`; moved `llm-wiki.md` to
  `docs/archive/llm-wiki.md`; deleted
  `workspace/human-agent-rule-divergence.md`; added the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-person-b-readme-archive-cleanup/`.
- Design review: root entry is now current and operational: skills are the
  runtime path, rules are detailed references, `llm_wiki_tools/` is the checker
  CLI, and the archived concept note is background only.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `python -m llm_wiki_tools validate-kernel` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  current README entrypoint language; file checks confirmed root `llm-wiki.md`
  is absent, archived `docs/archive/llm-wiki.md` exists, and
  `workspace/human-agent-rule-divergence.md` is deleted.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `b762b2e Refresh README and archive old concept note`; finalized by the
  follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Harden wiki coverage gate

- Target: strengthen source-packet-to-wiki and compare/closure behavior after
  the ADCtoolbox ch3 review showed that structurally valid output could still
  be far too shallow.
- Changed areas: updated wiki-round and quality-gate skills; hardened
  `rules/wiki/source-wiki-coverage-protocol.md`; added source outline,
  distillation depth, knowledge coverage, modality review, and anchor
  disposition fields to workspace report templates; extended `report-check`
  to require source coverage, anchor disposition, and wiki page coverage in
  compare reports; added pass/fail report-check fixtures for anchor
  disposition.
- Design review: this does not add an extractor or a wiki generator. It makes
  existing workflow artifacts coverage-aware so a full-round document/PPT
  distillation cannot pass only by citing broad page ranges or writing a clean
  summary.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending
  warnings; `python -m py_compile llm_wiki_tools/cli.py
  llm_wiki_tools/__main__.py` passed; `python -m llm_wiki_tools
  validate-kernel` passed; `python -m llm_wiki_tools fixture-runner` passed;
  `python -m llm_wiki_tools workspace-check --mode fixtures` passed. The
  ignored ADCtoolbox ch2-ch4 workspace now fails `workspace-check --mode all`
  at `report-check` because its old compare report lacks `Source Coverage`,
  `Anchor Disposition`, and `Wiki Page Coverage`.
- Commit: completed on `main` as `c811361 Harden wiki coverage gate`;
  finalized by the follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Run ADCtoolbox ch2-ch4 hardened redistillation

- Target: create a fresh ignored local workspace and redistill ADCtoolbox
  `ch2.pdf`, `ch3.pdf`, and `ch4.pdf` with the strengthened coverage-aware
  workflow.
- Changed areas: generated
  `workspace/local/adctoolbox-ch2-ch4-hardened-redistill/` with copied raw
  PDFs, source inventory, source packets, source/chapter wiki pages, overview,
  index, wiki log, construction analysis, compare report with source coverage
  and anchor disposition, review queue, validation note, and `.checks/`
  reports. Added the system target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-04-adctoolbox-ch2-ch4-hardened-redistill/`.
- Design review: this pass uses the new coverage gate. The ch3 chapter grows
  from the earlier dry run's 365 words and 11 page anchors to 1043 words and
  53 page anchors, with offset/gain, DNL, INL, FFT setup, leakage/windowing,
  spectral metrics, ERBW, IMD/MTPR, and static-to-dynamic links represented.
- Validation: `python -m llm_wiki_tools workspace-check --workspace
  workspace/local/adctoolbox-ch2-ch4-hardened-redistill --mode all --report
  workspace/local/adctoolbox-ch2-ch4-hardened-redistill/.checks/workspace-check-all.md`
  passed. Schema, source inventory, source packet, wiki lint, report, closure,
  and fixture checks passed.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `8c10dba Record ADCtoolbox hardened redistillation`; finalized by the
  follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-05 - Minimal formula derivation coverage hardening

- Target: make the smallest system adjustment after the ADCtoolbox redistill
  showed formulas and derivations can be lost while page-level coverage passes.
- Changed areas: updated wiki-round and quality-gate skills,
  `rules/wiki/source-wiki-coverage-protocol.md`, and compare/validation
  templates. Added the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-05-minimal-formula-derivation-coverage-hardening/`.
- Design review: no new rule file, schema, checker, fixture, or tool was
  added. The change reuses existing Claim Coverage, Modality Coverage,
  Knowledge coverage status, and closure fields to say that core
  formula/derivation loss is knowledge coverage, not merely nonblocking visual
  review.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending
  warnings; `python -m llm_wiki_tools validate-kernel` passed;
  `python -m llm_wiki_tools fixture-runner` passed.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `5fd8ff3 Clarify formula derivation coverage semantics`; finalized by the
  follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-05 - Define workspace topology contract

- Target: clarify how the system repo, workspace skeleton, workspace kernel
  bundle, and live knowledge workspace repo relate to each other.
- Changed areas: added
  `docs/top-level-design/workspace-topology-contract.md` and
  `templates/workspace-kernel/KERNEL-MANIFEST.md`; updated README, AGENTS,
  top-level design guidance, workspace skeleton docs, distill skill preflight,
  `llm_wiki_tools` command guidance, kernel validation, and the target plan
  under `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-05-workspace-topology-contract/`.
- Design review: the system now distinguishes `templates/workspace-kernel/` as
  the workspace skeleton, not the complete runtime bundle. A complete kernel
  bundle is skeleton plus copied or synchronized `skills/`, `rules/`,
  `contracts/schemas/`, and checker access. Live `raw/`, `wiki/`, and
  `reports/` belong to independent knowledge workspace repos.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending warnings;
  `python -m llm_wiki_tools validate-kernel` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed
  `workspace skeleton`, `kernel bundle`, `knowledge workspace repo`,
  `development tool mode`, `portable tool mode`, and boundary language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `43b83da Define workspace topology contract`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-05 - Complete Person A contract validation closure

- Target: close the current Person A workstream for concise machine-checkable
  contracts, validators, and representative fixtures before Phase 7.
- Changed areas: added
  `docs/collaboration/person-a-implementation-closure-review.md`; hardened
  `llm_wiki_tools` source packet and round closure checks; extended
  `fixture-runner` to run source validators; added PPTX/PDF source packet
  profile fixtures and a construction-analysis closure failure fixture; updated
  testing and tool README notes; added the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-05-person-a-contract-validation-closure/`.
- Design review: no new schema family was added. Person A closure reuses the
  existing compact contract set, source packet metadata, validation-note
  fields, reports, index, and log surfaces. The tools remain checker-only:
  they validate external packet/wiki/report outputs and do not run extractors
  or generate wiki prose.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending
  warnings; `python -m llm_wiki_tools validate-kernel` passed;
  `python -m llm_wiki_tools schema-check --workspace .` passed;
  `python -m llm_wiki_tools fixture-runner --fixture-root
  tests/fixtures/phase6` passed; `python -m llm_wiki_tools workspace-check
  --workspace . --mode fixtures` passed; targeted `rg` confirmed Person A
  closure and no-harness boundary language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `2d56981 Complete Person A contract validation closure`; finalized by the
  follow-up maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-05 - Mark repository as failed artifact

- Target: update the top-level README so future readers treat this repository
  as a failed project record rather than an active recommended workflow.
- Changed areas: updated `README.md`; added the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-05-mark-repository-failed/`.
- Design review: this is a minimal status change. Existing design history is
  preserved, but the README now states that the repository is too
  document-heavy, process-heavy, and indirect for its intended use.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed with only Windows line-ending
  warnings; targeted `rg` confirmed README failure notice language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `6201861 Mark repository as failed artifact`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.

## 2026-06-05 - Clarify README agent workflow value

- Target: refine the README failure notice to say that the LLM Wiki product
  goal failed, while the `AGENTS.md` + `docs/` + `plan/` Agent-assisted
  development workflow remains the useful artifact.
- Changed areas: updated the README top section; added the target plan under
  `plan/users/chenzc24/2026-06-05-readme-agent-workflow-value/`.
- Design review: this keeps the failed-product warning, but preserves the
  positive lesson: scoped plans, file ownership, dirty-state audits, logs,
  validation, and commit/push discipline are worth extracting into a smaller

  failure-boundary language.
- Commit: completed on `main` as
  `3ec03e4 Clarify README agent workflow value`; finalized by the follow-up
  maintenance-status commit.
